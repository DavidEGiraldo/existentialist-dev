Random existentialist messages for devs
Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g existentialist-dev
```

# Usage

```bash
 existentialist-dev
```

# Contributing
